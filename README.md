# User-Login-System
A login is a set of credentials used to authenticate a user. Most often, these consist of a `username` , `password` and `Confirm password`.<br>
Logins are used by `websites`, computer `applications`, and mobile `apps`. They are a security measure designed to prevent unauthorized access to confidential `data`.

# Examples of logins include:

- `Operating system` login ‚Äì Windows and Mac systems can be configured to require a login in order to use the computer after it is turned on or woken from sleep mode
- `Website` login ‚Äì Webmail interfaces, financial websites, and many other sites require a username and password in order to access account information.
- `App store` login ‚Äì App stores like Google Play and Apple's App Store require a login to download mobile apps, music, and other files.
- `FTP` login ‚Äì file transfer programs often require a login in order to browse, send, and receive files from an FTP server.
- `Router` login ‚Äì Wired and wireless routers typically require an administrator login to modify the settings.<br><br>

# User-Register-System

`User registration systems` are screens, forms, or profile pages that request information from a user to create a web-based account or profile. A user registration system generally asks a user to create a `username` and `password`, and possibly answer other security questions as well. Many user registration systems allow users to personalize their accounts and profiles; other registration systems provide users‚Äô account information for them. User registration systems are usually `HTML` and `PHP` programs.

# How to register a User?
The process for creating a custom login form is the same as for the registration form‚Äì just go to `Register Here` >> add all the fields you want. Once you're done, change the name of the form, click on `Register` Button and you're all set.üòç
